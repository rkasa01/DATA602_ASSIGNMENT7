Answers are collected based on a Cantril ladder life question. Participants are asked to think of lifestyles on a ladder, with their ideal and best possible life being at a 10, or the top of the ladder, and their worst possible life at a 0, or the very bottom of the ladder. They are then asked to rate their own lives on this scale along with six main observed factors that may contribute to their responses. These six factors are: economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity. This dataset features data collected from 2013-2016. \n#Happiness records are significant in recognizing the emotional and mental wellbeing of groups of people, and can, therefore, be used to make informed decisions on a governmental and organizational level to help improve quality of life for the general population. These reports can also be used to assess international progression. With this dataset, we can look at world happiness and use a variety of factors, such as social support and finances, to evaluate their potential impact on happiness. \n#I initially selected this dataset because of my interest in psychology. I am also curious to know how places all over the world compare to one another in terms of happiness, and what the contributive factors may be. For this assignment, I would like to see where the \"happiest\" place on Earth is, as well as the unhappiest, and assess potential reasons or factors. In order to use the most recent data, I will use data from the final year that this dataset includes: 2016. \n\n#The Kaggle dataset can be found using the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness\n\nimport pandas as pd\nurl1 = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rkasa01/DATA602_ASSIGNMENT7/main/world-happiness-report.csv\"\ndf1 = pd.read_csv(url1)\nprint(\"Variables in df1:\")\nprint(df1.columns)  # Prints variables\n\n#I first started by importing pandas and loaded the raw link for the dataset.

Using the summary statistics, we can find the average, median, and the different quartiles for each of the assessed categories. For exaple, the mean of the life ladder is about 5.47, the median is about 5.39, and the first quartile is at 4.64 whereas the third is at 6.28. The problem with this information, is that it is a bit disorganized and is generalized world data. At this step of the data exploratoion, we can also see that there are many missing values, so we would have to consider filtering out and dropping certain categories which are not too useful to finding out which country is the happiest, unhappiest, and possible contributing factors. In the next step, I will work to clean the data and make it more suitable to answer my question above. \n\n\n#Data Wrangling\n\n# World Happiness\nprint(\"World Happiness Records of 2016:\")\ndf1_2016 = df1[df1['year'] == 2016]  # Filter only for 2016, subset\ndf1_2016 = df1_2016.drop(columns=['year'])  # Remove the 'year' column\ndf1_2016 = df1_2016.sort_values(by='Life Ladder', ascending=False)  # Sort by life ladder in descending order\ndf1_2016 = df1_2016.drop(columns=['Generosity'])  # Drop the 'generosity' column from df1_2016\n# Rename columns\ndf1_2016 = df1_2016.rename(columns={\n    'Log GDP per capita': 'Per Capita Income',\n    'Freedom to make life choices': 'Freedom of Choice',\n    'Perceptions of corruption': 'Perceived Corruption',\n    'Healthy life expectancy at birth': 'Healthy Life Expectancy'\n})\n# Calculate 'Pos:Neg affect' ratio\ndf1_2016['Pos:Neg affect'] = df1_2016['Positive affect'] / df1_2016['Negative affect']\ndf1_2016.drop(['Positive affect', 'Negative affect'], axis=1, inplace=True)\ndf1_2016 = df1_2016.rename(columns={'Pos:Neg affect': 'pos:neg affect'})\n\ndf1_2016 = df1_2016.dropna(how='any')  # Drop rows with any missing values in any of the columns\ndf1_2016.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)\nprint(df1_2016)\n\n#Here I filtered the dataset to work with the most recent year, 2016.

I sorted the values for the life ladder score in descending order, such that the highest score appears first, and the lowest one appears last.

Conversely, per capita income had a correlation of about .83 with happiness, healthy life expectancy was about .80, social support was about .74, freedom of choice was about .51, and the positive:negative affect ratio was about .50.
